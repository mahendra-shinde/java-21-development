# Demo 02: Greeting Application

This demo showcases a simple Java application that demonstrates the use of classes and methods. The application consists of two main components:

1. **Greeting Class**:
   - Contains a method `greet(String name)` that prints a welcome message for the given name.
   - Example: If the name is "Mahendra", it prints `Hello Mahendra`.

2. **Main Class**:
   - Creates an instance of the `Greeting` class.
   - Calls the `greet` method to display a greeting message.
   - Demonstrates a loop to greet multiple users (e.g., User 1 to User 10).

### How to Run
1. Compile the Java files in the `src` directory.
2. Run the `Main` class to see the greeting messages in the console.
